        <h2>Java Introduction</h2>
        <h3>What is Java?</h3>
        <p><b>Java</b> is a set of computer software and specifications developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems,
         which was later acquired by the Oracle Corporation, that provides a system for developing application software and 
         deploying it in a cross-platform computing environment. Java is used in a wide variety of computing platforms from 
         embedded devices and mobile phones to enterprise servers and supercomputers. Java applets, which are less common than 
         standalone Java applications, were commonly run in secure, sandboxed environments to provide many features of native
          applications through being embedded in HTML pages..</p>
        <p>Writing in the Java programming language is the primary way to produce code that will be deployed as byte code in a Java
         virtual machine (JVM); byte code compilers are also available for other languages, including Ada, JavaScript, Python, and
         Ruby. In addition, several languages have been designed to run natively on the JVM, including Clojure, Groovy, and Scala. 
        Java syntax borrows heavily from C and C++, but object-oriented features are modeled after Smalltalk and Objective-C.
         Java eschews certain low-level constructs such as pointers and has a very simple memory model where objects are allocated 
         on the heap (while some implementations e.g. all currently supported by Oracle, may use escape analysis optimization to 
         allocating on the stack instead) and all variables of object types are references. Memory management is handled through 
         integrated automatic garbage collection performed by the JVM.</p>
        <p>On November 13, 2006, Sun Microsystems made the bulk of its implementation of Java available under the GNU General Public
         License (GPL)</p>
         <p>The latest versions are Java 12, released in March 2019, and Java 11, a currently supported long-term support (LTS) version
        ("Oracle Customers will receive Oracle Premier Support"), released on September 25, 2018; Oracle released for the "legacy" 
        Java 8 LTS the last free "public update" in January 2019 for commercial use, while it will otherwise still support Java 8
         with public updates for personal use up to at least December 2020. Oracle (and others) "highly recommend that you uninstall
        older versions of Java", because of serious risks due to unresolved security issues.Since Java 9 (and 10) is no longer 
        supported, Oracle advises its users to "immediately transition" to Java 11 (Java 12 is also an non-LTS option). Oracle 
        released the last public update for the legacy Java 8 LTS, which is free for commercial use, in January 2019. Java 8 will
        be supported with public updates for personal use up to at least December 2020. Oracle extended support for Java 6 ended 
        in December 2018.</p>
        <h3>Platform</h3>
        <p>The Java platform is a suite of programs that facilitate developing and running programs written in the Java programming
         language. A Java platform will include an execution engine (called a virtual machine), a compiler and a set of libraries;
        there may also be additional servers and alternative libraries that depend on the requirements. Java is not specific to any 
        processor or operating system as Java platforms have been implemented for a wide variety of hardware and operating systems
        with a view to enable Java programs to run identically on all of them. Different platforms target different classes of device
        and application domains:</p>
         <ul>
             <li>Java Card: A technology that allows small Java-based applications (applets) to be run securely on smart cards and
             similar small-memory devices</li>
             <li>Java ME (Micro Edition): Specifies several different sets of libraries (known as profiles) for devices with 
            limited storage, display, and power capacities. It is often used to develop applications for mobile devices,
            PDAs, TV set-top boxes, and printers.</li>
            <li>Java SE (Standard Edition): For general-purpose use on desktop PCs, servers and similar devices.</li>
            <li>Java EE (Enterprise Edition): Java SE plus various APIs which are useful for multi-tier clientâ€“server 
            enterprise applications</li>
         </ul>
         <p>The Java platform consists of several programs, each of which provides a portion of its overall capabilities. For example, the Java compiler, which converts Java source code into Java bytecode (an intermediate language for the JVM), is provided as part of the Java Development Kit (JDK). The Java Runtime Environment (JRE), complementing the JVM with a just-in-time (JIT) compiler, converts intermediate bytecode into native machine code on the fly. The Java platform also includes an extensive set of libraries.The essential components in the platform are the Java language compiler, the libraries, and the runtime environment in which Java intermediate bytecode executes according to the rules laid out in the virtual machine specification.</p>
         <h3>Java virtual machine</h3>
         <p>The heart of the Java platform is the concept of a "virtual machine" that executes Java bytecode programs. This bytecode is the same no matter what hardware or operating system the program is running under. However, new versions, such as for Java 10 (and earlier), have made small changes, meaning the bytecode is in general only forward compatible. There is a JIT (Just In Time) compiler within the Java Virtual Machine, or JVM. The JIT compiler translates the Java bytecode into native processor instructions at run-time and caches the native code in memory during execution.</p>
