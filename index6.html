        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Python is an easy to learn, powerful programming language. It has efficient high-level data structures and a simple
         but effective approach to object-oriented programming. Python’s elegant syntax and dynamic typing, together with 
        its interpreted nature, make it an ideal language for scripting and rapid application development in many areas on
         most platforms.</p>
         <p>The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are freely available in source or binary form for all major 
         platforms from the Python Web site, https://www.python.org/, and may be freely distributed. The same site also contains
         distributions of and pointers to many free third party Python modules, programs and tools, and additional documentation.</p>
         <p>The Python interpreter is easily extended with new functions and data types implemented in C or C++ (or other languages
         callable from C). Python is also suitable as an extension language for customizable applications.</p>
         <p>This tutorial introduces the reader informally to the basic concepts and features of the Python language and system. 
         It helps to have a Python interpreter handy for hands-on experience, but all examples are self-contained, so the tutorial
         can be read off-line as well.</p>
         <p>For a description of standard objects and modules, see The Python Standard Library. The Python Language Reference gives a 
         more formal definition of the language. To write extensions in C or C++, read Extending and Embedding the Python Interpreter
         and Python/C API Reference Manual. There are also several books covering Python in depth.</p>
         <p>This tutorial does not attempt to be comprehensive and cover every single feature, or even every commonly used feature.
         Instead, it introduces many of Python’s most noteworthy features, and will give you a good idea of the language’s flavor 
         and style. After reading it, you will be able to read and write Python modules and programs, and you will be ready to learn 
         more about the various Python library modules described in The Python Standard Library.</p>
         <h2>Python numbers</h2>
         <p>The interpreter acts as a simple calculator: you can type an expression at it and it will write the value. Expression syntax
        is straightforward: the operators +, -, * and / work just like in most other languages (for example, Pascal or C); 
        parentheses (()) can be used for grouping.</p>
        <p>Numeric types and operations using numbers There are three numeric types in Python: int for integers, float for decimal numbers, 
        and complex for complex numbers. General mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, and multiplication can be done on them.
        Operations when the type are the same: When the type of the input numbers are the same the result will be a number of the same class that
        the input numbers belong. This is true except the case of division as will be shown in the following examples.For
        example, you can assign the integers 2 and 3 to variables int_var and int_var1and then print the sum of the two.</p>
        <p>This checks if the object belongs to the class. We will throw more light on objects and how they belong to a class, or “object instantiation”, 
        in the objects and class tutorial. For now, just remember that an integer number is categorized into int class and hence if you check whether the 
        number 2 is an instance of the class int, the interpreter will return True.All numbers that are handled will belong to some type. A type is a way
        to define various data structures and containers and define the functionality associated with them. Types are implemented in Python as classes. If
        you want to verify if an integer belongs to the class int you can use isinstance. You will need to pass number as the first argument and class name
        as the second argument, and it will check if the object is an instance of the class.You can finally check if the same operation can be done on complex 
        numbers. Assign two complex numbers to two variables. say, complex_var and complex_var1 and print the sum of the two.In case of division, dividing two
        integers will always result in a float.Operations between numbers of different types: The operations work when operate of variables that are of different
        numeric types as well.For example you can add two numbers, one with class int and another with class float. The result will be in float. This is done by 
        changing the integer to a float and then adding them.Other operations like adding int to complex or float to complex works in similar manner. The results 
        of both the operations belong to the complex class.</p>
        <h3>Python Control Structures - Loops and Conditionals</h3>
        <p>You can control the flow of logic in your code through various methods.</p>
        <p>Basic control flows</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Selection (if statements)</li>
            <li>Iteration (for loops)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>More advanced control flows</p>

            <li>Recursion</li>
            <li>Concurrency</li>
            <li>Exception Handling and Speculation</li>
            <li>Nondeterminacy</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In this tutorial you will come to know:</p>
        <p>How to have sequential, selective and iterative
         flows in your code. This can be achieved using the for loop. How to achieve procedural abstraction. This can be done by
        the use of functions.Other topics like Recursion, Exception Handling, Concurrency will be discussed in later tutorials.</p>
        <h3>Loops</h3>
        <p>If you want to run an operation on a collection of items, then you can do it using for loops. The skeleton for using the
         for loop is shown below.Note that the for statement line will end with a colon : and the rest of the code block must be indented 
         with a spacing of 4 spaces. An iterable is any object that can be looped on such as list, tuple, string etc.Loops are important in
         Python or in any other programming language as they help you to execute a block of code repeatedly. You will often come face to face
         with situations where you would need to use a piece of code over and over but you don't want to write the same line of code multiple times.</p>
         <p>
        For loops are traditionally used when you have a block of code which you want to repeat a fixed number of times. The Python for statement iterates 
        over the members of a sequence in order, executing the block each time. Contrast the for statement with the ''while'' loop, used when a condition 
        needs to be checked each iteration, or to repeat a block of code forever</p>
        <p>A while loop statement in Python programming language repeatedly executes a target statement as long as a given condition is true.Here, statement(s) may be a single statement or a block of statements. The condition may be any expression, and true is any non-zero value. The loop iterates while the condition is true.

                When the condition becomes false, program control passes to the line immediately following the loop.
                
                In Python, all the statements indented by the same number of character spaces after a programming construct are considered to be part of a single block of code. Python uses indentation as its method of grouping statements.A loop becomes infinite loop if a condition never becomes FALSE. You must use caution when using while loops because of the possibility that this condition never resolves to a FALSE value. This results in a loop that never ends. Such a loop is called an infinite loop.

                An infinite loop might be useful in client/server programming where the server needs to run continuously so that client programs can communicate with it as and when required.</p>
        <P>In general, statements are executed sequentially: The first statement in a function is executed first, followed by the second, and so on. There may be a situation when you need to execute a block of code several number of times.

                Programming languages provide various control structures that allow for more complicated execution paths.
                
                A loop statement allows us to execute a statement or group of statements multiple times.</P>
